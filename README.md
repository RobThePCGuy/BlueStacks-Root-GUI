![GUI Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10f965eb-e1cc-4d61-9b6f-0cbb484a4ef0)

This tool allows you to toggle root access and enable read/write (R/W) permissions for your BlueStacks instances. It automatically detects both master and cloned instances, eliminating the need to manually edit configuration files as described in my original guide: **[Root BlueStacks with Kitsune Mask](https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Root-Bluestacks-with-Kitsune-Mask/)**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Auto-detection:** Quickly identifies BlueStacks instances from the Windows Registry.
- **Root Toggle:** Enables or disables root access **(`Root: On/Off`)** in `bluestacks.conf`.
- **Read/Write Permissions:** Easily sets filesystem permissions **(`R/W: On/Off`)** per instance.
- **Dynamic Status Updates:** Real-time GUI updates reflect current root and R/W states.
